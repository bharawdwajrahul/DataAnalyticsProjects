The Visualization is done with the help of [tableau](https://github.com/bharawdwajrahul/DataAnalyticsProjects/blob/main/Covid_DataSet_SQLQuery1.sql)

**Description**:
This project showcases my expertise in data analysis, visualization, and cleaning, applied to a comprehensive COVID-19 dataset. Leveraging SQL and Tableau, I led a thorough exploration of the data, ensuring its reliability through rigorous cleaning procedures. The project highlights my ability to derive critical insights, including population-adjusted infection rates, fatality rates, and global pandemic statistics using advanced calculations. These insights are effectively presented through visually engaging Tableau dashboards.

**Key Highlights**:
- Data exploration and visualization with SQL and Tableau.
- Robust data cleaning to ensure data consistency.
- Derivation of population-adjusted COVID-19 metrics.
- Effective communication of insights through Tableau dashboards.
